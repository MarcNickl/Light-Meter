# Light Meter
A semi Digital Light Meter

# Goals
To create a light meter using anlog inputs where all values of exposure are already entered and a Â± EV value is the output.

#Progress
As of writing this i have stripped down a gossen Luna F and gotten an arduino UNO

i am using the existing light sensor from the gossen as it has a really wide Dynamic range.

i have stolen the idea of having basicly two base iso's as there are 4 outputs on the light sensor so i can have a high gain and a low gain (using risistors)
